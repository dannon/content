Software {{Glossary("specification", "specifications")}} often contain information marked as **non-normative** or _informative_, which is provided to help readers understand the specification better or to show an example or best practice. This part of the specification does not need to be followed as a rule. Sections that contain the official part of the specification that must be followed are often marked as {{Glossary("normative")}}.
